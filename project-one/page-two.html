            which was released June 9, 2017, is the debut album by the American singer SZA.

            The first song I've ever interacted with from this album is <em>Love Galor (feat. Travis Scott)</em> on October 23, 2020 (according to Spotify from when I added it to my playlist). Since then, I added the song <em>Drew Barrymore</em> on December 5, 2021, and <em>Broken Clocks</em> on December 22, 2021.

            Recently, I was enjoying the absolutle phenomenal music that SZA makes with a friend, and they pointed out to me that I never ACTUALLY listened to the full album. As soon as they pointed that out, and I mean QUICKLY, I listened to the rest of her <em>Ctrl</em> album. Because the album came out in 2017, I have heard multiple of her songs around on the radio, in shows, on TikToc, and so on. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every second of each song, and really enjoy this album that SZA put out.

            My favorite songs from this album are: <em>Love Galore (feat. Travis Scott), Drew Barrymore, Broken Clocks,</em> and <em>Normal Girl</em>.
