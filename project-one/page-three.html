            I first discovered this album while going on a binge of various music in a 90's Hip Hop playlist made for my on spotify. Kendrick has always been one of my favorite artist, and this album further solidified that though through the songs on this album. One of the first songs that I interacted with was <em>i</em> on June 16, 2021, according to the date it was added on my spotify playlist.

            The song <em>i</em> by Kendrick Lamar is one of my absolute favorite songs that I listen to, and specifically it's cultural significance to me from the monologue that Kendrick gives that can be found in the last part of the song. The meanings and rhymes in this song are incredibly complex and I encourage you to look into it more!
        </p>

            My favorite songs from this album are: <em>i</em> and <em>For Sale? - Interlude</em>.
